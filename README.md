# Human Pose Estimation

## 🏃‍♂️ Project Overview

Human Pose Estimation is a cutting-edge computer vision task that detects key points on the human body to analyze movement and posture. This project leverages **real-time pose estimation** to track human skeletal movements, which can be applied in **fitness tracking, motion analysis, gaming, AI-driven sports analytics, and healthcare**.

Using **MediaPipe Pose** (or an alternative deep learning model), this project identifies and visualizes body key points, enabling seamless movement analysis with a webcam or pre-recorded videos.

## ✨ Features

✔️ **Real-time pose detection** using a webcam  
✔️ **Keypoint identification** (head, shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.)  
✔️ **Skeleton visualization** on detected poses  
✔️ **Smooth and optimized performance** with OpenCV & MediaPipe  
✔️ **Scalability** – Can be extended for gesture recognition, fitness tracking, and AR applications  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, MediaPipe (or TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning-based models)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib (if needed for keypoint mapping)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-link>
cd <project-folder>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the pose estimation script
python main.py
```

⚡ **Ensure you have a webcam connected** for real-time detection. If using a deep learning model.

## 📜 Code Explanation

The main script captures video frames, processes them using MediaPipe’s Pose module, and overlays detected keypoints on the frame. Below is a snippet demonstrating how keypoints are extracted:

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp

mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
pose = mp_pose.Pose()

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Convert frame to RGB
    rgb_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    results = pose.process(rgb_frame)
    
    # Extract and visualize keypoints
    if results.pose_landmarks:
        for landmark in results.pose_landmarks.landmark:
            x, y = int(landmark.x * frame.shape[1]), int(landmark.y * frame.shape[0])
            cv2.circle(frame, (x, y), 5, (0, 255, 0), -1)
    
    cv2.imshow('Pose Estimation', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This script captures real-time video, processes each frame, and marks keypoints on detected human poses.



## 🚀 Future Enhancements

🔹 Improve accuracy using deep learning-based models (e.g., OpenPose, HRNet).  
🔹 Add gesture recognition for interactive applications.  
🔹 Deploy as a web or mobile app for fitness tracking.  
🔹 Implement pose correction feedback for exercise guidance.
